# Predictive Power of Expenditures Analysis

This R markdown file contains the necessary markdown, commentary, and code to produce a knitr'd PDF presenting my analysis of my wife and I's US Dollar Expenditure Data from ~April 2014 to ~July 2018.

This file assumes that the provided data source file ("PersonalExpenditureData.zip") is available in your working directory.

This analysis is intended to provide a demonstrative sample of my ability to conduct and narrate analysis using self-developed institutional knowledge (personal data, self-assembled; I'm aware of contextual, absent metadata), Excel, and R.

## Context

Recently, while reviewing our finances together, my wife and I discussed differences between weekday and weekend spending.  I had already plotted average spend by day-of-week, but I began to ask myself whether the expenditure data held any predictive value.

As we are repatriating to the US in August, and I am currently seeking work in analysis in Providence, RI, and demonstrable analytical ability is helpful in that pursuit, a small investigation seemed appropriate - and so here we are.

## Premise

My wife and I, both early/mid-career, white-collar professionals, have generally adhered to the Monday - Friday workweek conventional in the west.  As most people struggle to spend money during employment hours (excepting lunches, coffee, etc.), it seems safe to say that our expenditures are lower during the week than at the weekend.

The question here then is whether I can predict either:

- Weekday from Weekend, or
- Which specific day of the week

Any particular day is using other attributes of our various expenditures.

## Data, Broadly

As part of my wife and I's personal financial hygiene, I have recorded each of our US Dollar financial transactions from ~April 2014.  The collected columns/attributes have grown and adjusted over time, but the core of Date, Local Time to the quarter hour, Vendor, and Dr/Cr amounts have not changed.

## Data, Quality

While I'm certain the data are not 100% perfect, I am similarly certain that the error rate is negligibly small.  Informed by professional habits, I've been disciplined about data entry habits/controls (various account rec's, etc., personal month-end closes, etc.) such that errors, where they exist, are not material.



```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
