Public Facing Analysis of Personal Expenditure Data

This repo contains the various files associated with my analysis of my wife and I's US Dollar Expenditure Data from ~April 2014 to ~July 2018.

All content here is intended to provide a demonstrative sample of my ability to conduct and narrate analysis using self-developed institutional knowledge (personal data, self-assembled; I'm aware of contextual, absent metadata), Excel, and R.

At 11 July 2018, this is still unlinked WIP.  Objective is to eventually include in LinkedIn profile and to potential employers.
