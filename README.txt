# Expenditure-Analysis
Public Facing Analysis of whether Personal Expenditure Data can predict DoW and/or Weekday vs. Weekend.

This repo contains the various files associated with my quick interrogation of my wife and I's US Dollar Expenditure Data from April 2014 to ~July 2018.

All content here is intended to provide a demonstrative sample of my ability to conduct and narrate analysis using self-developed institutional knowledge (personal data, self-assembled; I'm aware of contextual, absent metadata), Excel, and R.

At 11 July 2018, this is still unlinked WIP.  Objective is to eventually include in LinkedIn profile and to potential employers.
