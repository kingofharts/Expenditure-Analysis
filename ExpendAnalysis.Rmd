This R markdown file contains the necessary markdown, commentary, and code to produce a knitr'd PDF presenting my analysis of my wife and I's US Dollar Expenditure Data from ~April 2014 to ~July 2018.

This file assumes that the provided data source file ("PersonalExpenditureData.zip") is available in your working directory.

This analysis is intended to provide a demonstrative sample of my ability to conduct and narrate analysis using self-developed institutional knowledge (personal data, self-assembled; I'm aware of contextual, absent metadata), Excel, and R.

## Premise and Context

As part of my wife and I's personal financial hygiene, I have recorded each of our US Dollar financial transactions from ~April 2014.

While reviewing some of the data, 

While I'm certain the data are not 100% perfect, I am similarly certain that the error rate is negligibly small.  Informed by professional habits, I've been disciplined about data entry habits/controls (various account rec's, etc., personal month-end closes, etc.) such that errors, where they exist, are not material.



```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
